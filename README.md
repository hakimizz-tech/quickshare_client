# QuickShare

## Overview

Welcome to QuickShare, a modern web application designed for fast and reliable file sharing. QuickShare solves a common problem faced by users of popular messaging services and email clients like WhatsApp and Gmail, which often have strict file size limits. 

This application handles the upload of large files by breaking them into smaller chunks, ensuring a robust and resumable process, even on unstable network connections. It provides a reliable solution for sharing high-quality videos, large project archives, and other big data files without compression or loss of quality.

## Key Features

**Chunked Uploads:** Large files (up to 2GB) are automatically split into smaller chunks. This allows the upload to continue from where it left off if the network connection is interrupted.

**Progress Tracking:** Users can see the real-time progress of their upload, including the percentage complete.

**Resumability:** If an upload fails or is paused, the user can resume it without losing any progress. The application intelligently determines which chunks still need to be uploaded.

**Secure Sharing:** Upon successful upload, the application provides a unique, temporary download link for secure file sharing.
